# 📦 Milestone 4 - User Model, Controller & File Uploads  

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to Milestone 4 of our e-commerce application development! In this phase, we focus on defining the User Model, creating the User Controller, and setting up Multer for file uploads.  

---

## 🛠 Key Features  

### 🗺 What’s a Model?  
- A model acts as a detailed map or plan for structuring data.  
- The **User Model** defines how user data (e.g., name, email, password) is stored in the database.  
- In **MongoDB**, we use **Schemas** to define the structure of a model.  

### 🎯 What’s a Controller?  
- A **controller** manages how the server responds to different requests.  
- For example, the **User Controller** handles user signup by managing data flow between the frontend and database.  
- Think of it as a **"manager"** ensuring smooth communication between different parts of the app.  

### 📂 File Uploads with Multer  
- Users may need to upload files like profile pictures.  
- **Multer** is a Node.js middleware that helps manage file uploads efficiently.  
- It allows storing user images on the server, acting like a virtual **file cabinet**.  

---

## 📝 Steps for Milestone 4  

This milestone will be covered in a **mentor-led lesson**, where your mentor will guide you through:  

1. **Explaining and creating the User Model**  
2. **Creating the User Controller**  
3. **Setting up Multer for file uploads**

# 📝 Milestone 5 - Sign-Up Page & Form Validation  

## 📌 Overview  
Welcome to Milestone 5 of our e-commerce application development! In this phase, we will focus on creating the **Sign-Up Page** and implementing **form validation** to ensure a smooth user experience.  

---

## 🛠 Key Features  

### 📝 What’s a Sign-Up Page?  
- The **Sign-Up Page** allows users to enter their details to create an account.  
- It typically includes fields like:  
  - **Name**  
  - **Email**  
  - **Password**  
- Once the user fills out the form, the data is sent to the **server** for processing.  
- We’ll design a **clean and user-friendly** sign-up form.  

### ✅ What is Form Validation?  
- **Form Validation** ensures that the information users enter is in the correct format.  
- Key validation checks include:  
  - **Email format validation** (ensuring a valid email structure).  
  - **Password validation** (checking length and security criteria).  
- Validation helps prevent **errors** and ensures that the backend receives **clean data**.  

---

## 📝 Steps for Milestone 5  

In this milestone, you will work on the **frontend**, while your mentor will guide you through:  

1. **Building the Sign-Up Page** using HTML and CSS.  
2. **Adding form validation** to ensure users input valid data.
